# Attendance-system


The Attendance System using Python OpenCV Numpy is a program that utilizes facial recognition technology to automate attendance marking. The program requires a webcam to capture the image of the person, which is then processed using OpenCV and Numpy libraries. These libraries help in image processing tasks such as face detection, alignment, and recognition. The system compares the captured image with images in the database and marks attendance if a match is found.

The system has the ability to handle multiple users and provides an option to add or remove users from the database. The program can recognize faces even in different lighting conditions and with various facial expressions. The attendance data is stored in a file or database, making it easy to maintain and analyze attendance records.

The Attendance System using Python OpenCV Numpy can be useful in various institutions, including schools, colleges, and offices, to automate attendance marking and save time and effort. It eliminates the need for manual attendance marking, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The system can be integrated with other software systems and can also be used for security purposes, such as controlling access to restricted areas.

Overall, the Attendance System using Python OpenCV Numpy is an efficient and reliable way to mark attendance. Its use of facial recognition technology and integration with other software systems make it a powerful tool for institutions looking to automate their attendance marking process.
